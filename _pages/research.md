Research plays a central role in my stay at the Florida International University. My research [group](https://arcs-lab.eng.fiu.edu/) has expertise in the area of design automation for electronic systems. More specifically, include advanced real-time computing, embedded system design, thermal/power-aware computing, advanced computer architecture, and high performance computing. I am motivated to extend these fundamentals and apply towards the latest technology of the artificial intelligence in autonomous vehicle design. I have focused on the challenges to optimize the thermal-aware lifetime reliability of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) through effective resource utilization for autonomous vehicle applications. Till now, I have explored the technique to optimize the ECU reliability and currently working on GPU part.
