Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.fiu.edu/) at the Florida International University; my advisor is [Dr. Gang Quan](http://web.eng.fiu.edu/gaquan/). My research interests are Thermal/Power-aware Computing, Advanced Real-Time Computing System Design, and Deep Neural Network Sensitivity Estimation. For my research, I have collaborated with [Dr. Vivek Chaturvedi](https://iitpkd.ac.in/people/vivek), Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad, India and [Dr. Shi Sha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=stCFoCgAAAAJ&hl=en), Wilkes University, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

I received a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Telecommunication in 2010 and a Master of Engineering in Electronics (Digital Systems) in 2013 from the Savitribai Phule Pune University. I have worked as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering at the [Vidya Pratishthan's Kamalnayan Bajaj Institute of Engineering and Technology](https://www.vpkbiet.org/), 2013â€“2018. In Fall 2018, I moved to the Florida International University for my doctoral study.

Currently, I am doing cutting-edge research on thermal-aware lifetime reliability optimization for the processing units (ECUs and GPUs) in autonomous vehicles. I am  equipped with a rich skillset in Python, PyTorch, Matlab, C, C++, Embedded C, VHDL, and CPLEX programming.
